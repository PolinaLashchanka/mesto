# MESTO
### My third project created during Ya.Practicum course "WEB developer"
##### This is a single page application, where you can create your own account, post information about yourself and add photos.
##### When you click the button next to the user name, a form for editing information about the user will open.
#### Technological stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Figma
#### Installation:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PolinaLashchanka/mesto.git

npm install
npm run dev
```
##### Plans for improvement: 
- re-implement using React
##### *[Here](https://polinalashchanka.github.io/react-mesto-auth/) you will find a link to final version of this project*
